# Elixir Playground
Playground to testdrive [Elixir](http://www.elixir-lang.org) and its capababilities in supporting development of web based software.
This is loosely based on [Introduction to Mix](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)

Try out the Repl using `iex -S mix`, test the application via `mix test` or compile it via `mix compile`

### Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add kv to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:kv, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure kv is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:kv]]
        end
